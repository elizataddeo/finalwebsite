                          <p>I am 1 of 4 siblings that were rescued and started out at Animal Control but we were so little and still needed lots of care, so we were taken in by BTKR's amazing bottle feeders who took amazing care of us. When we were old enough we were moved to our new foster home, where we quickly found that there were even more amazing humans to love us along with lots of foster siblings to play with!</p>
                          <p>I love the laser pointer, wands, fuzzy balls, and the ball tower. I sure love that ball tower! My favorite things are laying in the warm sunshine, wrestling and playing with my sister, and chasing the laser pointer or wands. I am super playful with my siblings and other fosters. I love Fancy Feast Gravy and Purina One kitten dry food. I also love those Temptations treats, especially in the morning!</p>

  <h3 class="text-center">Fostering is a full-time commitment, but it is a necessary and a large part of our rescue efforts!<br>We are the largest foster-based rescue on the East Coast, and we are always in need of dedicated fosters.</h3>

  <h4 class="text-center">What is Fostering and why is it important?</h4>
<ul class="text-center">
<li>Fostering allows a cat the chance to know what it feels like to be loved and cared for.</li>

<li>Fostering reduces the number of cats and kittens in shelters or on the streets.</li>

<li>Fostering makes room for rescues to save other cats and kittens.</li>

<li>Fostering helps shy cats learn to socialize so they can be adopted out. </li>

<li>Fostering gives a cat the opportunity to live in a home rather than inside a cage.</li>

<li>Fostering literally SAVES LIVES!</li></ul>
